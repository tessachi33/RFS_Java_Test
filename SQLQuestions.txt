SQL

Demonstrate your SQL knowledge by solving the following problems.

Given the following tables:

Course
Course Number(PK)
Course Name
Professor ID
Term
Credits

Professor
Professor ID(PK)
Professor Name
Department


	•	Construct a query that returns all courses with at least 3 credits and those that are only offered in the “fall” semester.

	•	Construct a query that returns the professor name of all professors that teach “Intro to C#”.

	•	Construct a relational table that would allow you to easily join these two tables together.

	•	If the Course table contains millions of records, what could you do to increase the speed of queries that constantly filter on the “Term” and the “Credits” columns?
