SQL

Demonstrate your SQL knowledge by solving the following problems.

Given the following tables:

Course
Course Number(PK)
Course Name
Professor ID
Term
Credits

Professor
Professor ID(PK)
Professor Name
Department


	•	Construct a query that returns all courses with at least 3 credits and those that are only offered in the “fall” semester.
	<!--PSEUDOCODE -->

   SELECT * FROM courses WHERE credits id = 3 and course id = 3 and term id  is "fall"

	•	Construct a query that returns the professor name of all professors that teach “Intro to C#”.
	<!--PSEUDOCODE -->

	 SELECT * FROM Professor Name and course id "intro to c#""


	•	Construct a relational table that would allow you to easily join these two tables together.
	<!--PSEUDOCODE -->

	JOIN Professor Name with course id "intro to c#" ON table WHERE course id = 3 and "fall"


	•	If the Course table contains millions of records, what could you do to increase the speed of queries that constantly filter on the “Term” and the “Credits” columns?

	##I would add them to the same table since it is rare that a term with              decrease or increase credits.
